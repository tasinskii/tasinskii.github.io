      Hi, my name is Timofei Asinski. Im a computer science student within Northwestern University's
      McCormick School of Engineering. I'm currently conducting algorithms-related research within the McCue research group
        and under Professor Konstantin Makarychev. In the past, I've worked on projects ranging from computer vision to web3 Solana analytics.
        You can reach me at timofei@u.northwestern.edu.

        <h1 class= "font-bold">✱ Image Denoising with Monte Carlo Markov Chain Gibbs Sampling </h1>
          Implemented in Python as part of a course in probabilistic graphical models. Images are 
        represented by the Ising Model, originally used in statistical mechanics. To learn the 
        relationships between pixel positions and a noisy image, a random walk is taken along the
        markov chain of image state possibilities, with more probabilistically likely samples used to update
        the graphical model's parameters. Some results: <a class= "underline text-blue-600" href= "mnist.png">MNIST</a>, <a class= "underline text-blue-600" href= "cat.png">Cat</a>.

        <h1 class= "font-bold">✱ Northwestern Meal Bazaar -- <a class= "underline text-blue-600">Link</a></h1>
          A web application created with Ruby on Rails and Tailwind CSS. The idea for this website came out of 
        a conversation I had with one of my friends, and I figured it would be a good exercise in learning some UI frameworks
        and secure and scaleable web app design. The site allows NU students to bid on and offer up dining hall/meal swipes. 
        Some features include session-based authentication and rate-limiting for login and signup. The app was deployed using Kamal,
        a containerization platform that interfaces with Docker containers.

          My first two summers at Northwestern, I worked in the VPD Lab, a materials science research group focused
        on electron microscopy. As part of my work, I created a GUI application to process and analyze 4D Scanning
        Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D STEM) data. This data can offer a wealth of information about a sample, 
        so as part of my GUI tool, I incorporated a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine the thickness of a 
        sample. Additionally, users can use the tool to develop processed images based on a chosen sub-section of the total
        data.

        I've been developing small Python and Rust tools for the Solana Blockchain on and off since 2023. Recently, I've created 
        an asynchronous trading client and software to search block data for bundled token (in layman's terms, a scam) detection. Right now, 
        I'm working on a backtesting framework for testing several trading algorithms.

        <h1 class= "font-bold"> ✱ Animated WebGL Scene with Textures and Phong Lighting --  <a class= "underline text-blue-600" href= "project3/project3.html">Link</a></h1>
          For my Computer Graphics class, our final project was to incorporate a Phong lighting model and
        textures into a scene of our choosing. The scene shows a low-poly version of myself pouring tea for 
        a low-poly version of my girlfriend, Maya. I modeled the figures and textures in Blender. The project
        first parses the saved Blender .obj files, then for every frame draws the models, textures, and lighting to the screen, and applies transformations to the models 
         to animate the figures. The user can manipulate the position 
        of a camera, as well as the position of the light source.
